> Hey!,

I'm Txell Amigó, also known as txellext on social media platforms. 

I am a Bioinformatician with a strong foundation in Microbiology. My career journey has led me to the exciting intersection of science and programming, where I am specializing in the computational study of omics data.
 
In addition to my scientific pursuits, I've ventured into web development, with a particular focus on front-end technologies. 

My passion for computer science drives me to continuously explore new technologies like Machine Learning, engage in creative coding projects and care about reproducible research and open science.
